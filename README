A website that lists freelance web development jobs.

Only freelance. No middlemen. Local. Curated. Free Forever.

I created it because I was frustrated that I had to navigate between different websites, go through tangled searches, and contend with middlemen to get to what was relevant to me. I want to make finding freelance jobs easier.

How it works:

You type in your zipcode. And all freelance dev jobs appear in a nicely designed list.

Sincerely,

Marcus
